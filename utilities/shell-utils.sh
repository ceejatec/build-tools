    # Several interesting things going on here.
    #
    # 1. `skopeo inspect` won't fail if you specify, say,
    #    `--override-arch arm64` and the image is a single-arch amd64
    #    image; it will just return the details of the amd64 image.
    #    Since those details *do* include the arch, we capture that and
    #    compare it to the requested arch. If they're not the same, we
    #    just return an empty string key.
    # 2. Docker uses "content-addressable IDs", which means they only
    #    contain filesystem/metadata diffs. As such, it's quite possible
    #    for two different images to share a layer SHA. One common way
    #    this can occur is with the `ENTRYPOINT` directive - that only
    #    affects metadata and has no timestamp information, so basically
    #    *every* image that has the same `ENTRYPOINT ["foo"]` will share
    #    the same layer SHA. Since `ENTRYPOINT` is frequently the last
    #    directive in a Dockerfile, that means it's not at all uncommon
    #    for two different images to share the same top layer. This is
    #    unlike git, where if you see the same commit SHA in two places,
    #    you can be completely sure that the entire history of those two
    #    places is also identical.
    #
    # The upshot is that if we want to check to see if two images on a
    # remote registry are "the same", we have to compare their entire
    # set of layer SHAs. To do this we gather them all, sort them, and
    # form our own sha256 checksum of that list.
